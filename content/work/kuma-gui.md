The Kuma GUI is a front-end application for managing Kuma resources, policies, and other data from the comfort of your web browser.
Built entirely in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), it runs from within Kuma itself and offers at-a-glance details about your Dataplanes,
various Policies, and other mesh service information. This project has offered a wealth of unique problems to solve.
