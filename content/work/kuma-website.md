Kuma is an open-source control plane solution for service mesh and microservices. I was tasked with building a website that
served as both a presentation of the product itself, and as housing for its documentation. For this, I used
[VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), coupled with a layer of customization that adds features VuePress does not currently
offer. Kuma is also [a CNCF Sandbox project](https://konghq.com/blog/kuma-0-7-0-released-with-new-zone-resource-new-proxytemplate-statefulset-support-and-more/), open source and vendor neutral!
