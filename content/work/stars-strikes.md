Stars & Strikes is a Georgia-based franchise of family fun centers that offer bowling, laser tag, escape rooms, and even virtual reality. Chris and I were tasked with putting together a complex WordPress-driven framework that allows the user to set their closest Stars & Strikes location, which then globally modifies the site data to display specials, events and other things. I was tasked with building a pattern library, as well as writing all of the Sass, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, and Twig.
