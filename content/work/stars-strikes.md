Stars & Strikes is a Georgia-based franchise of family fun centers that offer bowling, laser tag, escape rooms, and even virtual reality. Chris and I were tasked with putting together a complex WordPress-driven framework that allows the user to set their closest Stars & Strikes location, which then globally modifies the site data to display specials, events and other things. I was tasked with building an [Astrum-driven](https://github.com/NoDivide/astrum) pattern library, as well as writing all of the Sass, JavaScript, HTML and a lot of PHP. This site is unique because it leverages the [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/) WordPress plugin, which allows us to write our templates using the Twig templating engine. Our Big Sea base WordPress theme uses this at the core as well.
