If there is one thing to know about the Tampa Bay area, it's that the people here love craft beer. We delivered. This was a passion project originally started by my friend and colleague <a href="https://chrislagasse.com/">Chris Lagasse</a> and pioneered by the <a href="https://bigsea.co/">Big Sea</a> team. I was tasked with all of the front end code. This included JavaScript, Sass, HTML, UI/UX, and working with Chris to integrate with ExpressionEngine.
