# [daryn.codes](https://daryn.codes)

## Now running on [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/)!

This is the source for [my website](https://daryn.codes/). It is built in [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/), and hosted on [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/now).

## Why the switch to Gridsome?

I wanted to be able to have a blog but not rely on third party services like Ghost or Contentful. The methods for handling those approaches in Nuxt were a bit convoluted and problematic, so I jumped into Gridsome as an experiment and was pleasantly surprised. I was able to convert my site over in 2 nights.

I also love the vast array of plugins and starters available in Gridsome, and the use of GraphQL for querying data. There is a ton of efficiency and simplicity there. I was able to convert both my [Journal](https://daryn.codes/journal/) and my [Work](https://daryn.codes/work/) pages to Markdown that gets processed and queried via GraphQL.

### Running

- Run locally: `yarn develop` (runs `gridsome develop`)
