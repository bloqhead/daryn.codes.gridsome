        My name is
        <span itemprop="givenName">Daryn</span> and I build
        <g-link to="/work/">websites</g-link>&nbsp;in sunny St. Petersburg
        Florida. I like to experiment on
        <a href="https://codepen.io/bloqhead">Codepen</a> and have been featured
        on the front page multiple times, as well as in
        <a href="https://codepen.io/spark/">Codepen Spark</a>.

        I do it all. I've been in the game since circa 2001 and refuse to stop
        learning.

    <h3>It all started as a kid&hellip;</h3>

    <p class="attn">
      I was heavily influenced by 80s and 90s culture, as well as my
      computer-savvy father. Before I was born, he was a contractor for NASA and
      worked on computer systems that were used in space capsules. With his
      guidance, I was eventually navigating
      <abbr title="Microsoft Disk Operating System">MS-DOS</abbr> like a pro.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>This upbringing, coupled with my artistic roots (and a couple failed art school attempts), eventually evolved into a graphic design career that gifted me with many interesting experiences and problems to solve.</p>

    <p>Along the way I also picked up some coding experience and directed my focus to front end development with some back end experience sprinkled in for good measure. I'm full-stack in every sense and even have some sysadmin skills to boot (I used to manage an Apache webserver with ~70 websites). Don't let the baby face deceive you; I've been in the scene for a while.</p>-->
